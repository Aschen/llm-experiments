<Action name="analysis" usage="analysis of the answer to the question based on the criteria"> parameter:analysis="The answer provided does not adequately address the question asked. The question was about good practices in terms of remuneration, particularly the balance between fixed salary, variable salary, and BSPCE (French stock options), and a system that rewards employees who invest themselves. However, the answer focuses on equity distribution in a startup, which is a different topic. It does not discuss the balance between different types of remuneration or how to reward employees who invest themselves. The answer is well-structured and provides a detailed discussion on the topic of equity distribution, but it does not answer the question asked." parameter:note="3/10" />
