While it does provide a discussion on the appropriate salary level for a startup and the use of company shares (BSPCE) as an incentive, it does not delve into the balance between fixed and variable salary, which was a specific part of the question. Furthermore, the answer does not explain the pros and cons of different remuneration strategies, nor does it discuss the legal and financial implications of BSPCE. The impact of these strategies on employee motivation and company performance is also not addressed. The answer does provide some insight into the views of different participants on the topic, but it does not demonstrate a deep understanding of the subject matter as required by the criteria." parameter:note="4/10" />
