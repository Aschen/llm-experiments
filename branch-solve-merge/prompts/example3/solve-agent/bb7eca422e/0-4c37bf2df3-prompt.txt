A question was asked to you:
# BEGIN QUESTION
Could modern day humans, with all their technology, defeat a T-Rex? If so, what would it take?
# END QUESTION


You need to evaluate the pertinence of an answer based on the following criteria:
# BEGIN CRITERIA
The answer should demonstrate originality and creativity in its approach to the question. It should not simply state that humans could defeat a T-Rex with guns or bombs, but should propose a unique or innovative method of doing so. This could involve the use of technology in a way that is not typically associated with combat, or a strategy that exploits a specific weakness of the T-Rex.
# END CRITERIA

This criteria is used to evaluate the answer.

The answer is:
# BEGIN ANSWER
Yes, modern-day humans, with all their technology, could indeed defeat a T-Rex. Today's technology far exceeds anything that existed during the time of the dinosaurs. It would likely take a moderate-sized military force equipped with weaponry such as tanks, artillery, and firearms to kill a T-Rex. Alternatively, even a single well-armed drone could potentially accomplish this task, given that dinosaurs wouldn't have any defenses against aerial attacks.
# END ANSWER
