A question was asked to you:
# BEGIN QUESTION
Could modern day humans, with all their technology, defeat a T-Rex? If so, what would it take?
# END QUESTION


You need to evaluate the pertinence of an answer based on the following criteria:
# BEGIN CRITERIA
The answer should be grounded in reality and should take into account the current technological capabilities of humans. It should consider the size, strength, and other characteristics of a T-Rex and how modern technology could potentially be used to defeat it. The answer should not include unrealistic or impossible scenarios, such as using magic or unproven technology.
# END CRITERIA

This criteria is used to evaluate the answer.

The answer is:
# BEGIN ANSWER
Yes, modern-day humans, with all their technology, could indeed defeat a T-Rex. Today's technology far exceeds anything that existed during the time of the dinosaurs. It would likely take a moderate-sized military force equipped with weaponry such as tanks, artillery, and firearms to kill a T-Rex. Alternatively, even a single well-armed drone could potentially accomplish this task, given that dinosaurs wouldn't have any defenses against aerial attacks.
# END ANSWER

Write an extensive analysis on the answer to the question based on the criteria.
Also give a note on 10 to the answer based on the criteria.
