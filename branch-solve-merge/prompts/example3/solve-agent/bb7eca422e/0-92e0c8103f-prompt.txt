A question was asked to you:
# BEGIN QUESTION
Could modern day humans, with all their technology, defeat a T-Rex? If so, what would it take?
# END QUESTION


You need to evaluate the pertinence of an answer based on the following criteria:
# BEGIN CRITERIA
The answer should demonstrate originality and creativity in its approach to the question. It should not simply state that humans could defeat a T-Rex with guns or bombs, but should propose a unique or innovative method of doing so. This could involve the use of technology in a way that is not typically associated with combat, or a strategy that exploits a specific weakness of the T-Rex.
# END CRITERIA

This criteria is used to evaluate the answer.

The answer is:
# BEGIN ANSWER
Yes, modern day humans with their technology could definitely defeat a T-Rex. The weaponry and technology we possess today far surpasses anything that was available during the time of the dinosaurs. 

To defeat a T-Rex, it would potentially take a combination of advanced weaponry and strategic planning. This could include the use of heavy artillery or firearms, which could incapacitate or kill the dinosaur from a safe distance. Additionally, various trapping mechanisms could be used to immobilize the T-Rex, allowing for its safe capture or elimination. 

In terms of non-lethal methods, tranquilizer darts used in modern wildlife conservation could also potentially be used to subdue a T-Rex. However, these would likely need to be significantly sized up given the dinosaur's size and weight. 

It's important to note that while this is a hypothetical scenario, in reality, it would be more beneficial to study and learn from such a magnificent creature, should it be found in existence, rather than attempt to defeat it.
