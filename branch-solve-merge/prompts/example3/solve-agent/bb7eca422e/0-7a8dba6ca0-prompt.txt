# BEGIN QUESTION
Could modern day humans, with all their technology, defeat a T-Rex? If so, what would it take?
# END QUESTION


You need to evaluate the pertinence of an answer based on the following criteria:
# BEGIN CRITERIA
The answer should incorporate humor in a way that is relevant to the question. This could involve a humorous scenario, a clever pun, or a funny twist on the idea of humans fighting a T-Rex. The humor should not detract from the realism or creativity of the answer, but should add an additional layer of entertainment to the response.
# END CRITERIA

This criteria is used to evaluate the answer.

The answer is:
# BEGIN ANSWER
Yes, modern day humans with all their technology could defeat a T-Rex. The technology we have today is much more advanced than what was available during the era of the dinosaurs. 

In terms of weaponry, a large caliber firearm could potentially kill a T-Rex, though it may take several shots to incapacitate such a large animal. Military grade weapons such as a tank or a rocket launcher would have a much higher chance of success. 

Moreover, humans could also use traps, like pitfalls or snares, to immobilize the dinosaur. Using technology, humans could detect the T-Rex from a safe distance, track its movements, and strategize accordingly.

Another advantage is our knowledge of biology and pharmacology. We could potentially use tranquilizers or other means to incapacitate the T-Rex without having to physically confront it. 

So, while a T-Rex is a formidable creature, the technology of modern day humans makes them more than capable of handling such a threat.
