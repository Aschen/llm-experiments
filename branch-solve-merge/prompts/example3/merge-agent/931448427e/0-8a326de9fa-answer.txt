<Action name="mergedAnswer" parameter:answer="Yes, modern-day humans, with all their technology, could indeed defeat a T-Rex. Today's technology far exceeds anything that existed during the time of the dinosaurs. It would likely take a moderate-sized military force equipped with weaponry such as tanks, artillery, and firearms to kill a T-Rex. Alternatively, even a single well-armed drone could potentially accomplish this task, given that dinosaurs wouldn't have any defenses against aerial attacks. Moreover, humans could also use traps, like pitfalls or snares, to immobilize the dinosaur. Using technology, humans could detect the T-Rex from a safe distance, track its movements, and strategize accordingly. Another advantage is our knowledge of biology and pharmacology. We could potentially use tranquilizers or other means to incapacitate the T-Rex without having to physically confront it. However, it's important to note that while this is a hypothetical scenario, in reality, it would be more beneficial to study and learn from such a magnificent creature, should it be found in existence, rather than attempt to defeat it." />
