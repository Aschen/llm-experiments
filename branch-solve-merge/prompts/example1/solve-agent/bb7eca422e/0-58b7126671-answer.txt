<Action name="analysis" usage="analysis of the answer to the question based on the criteria"> parameter:analysis="The answer provided is quite relevant and meets the criteria well. It provides industry benchmarks by mentioning the daily active users to monthly active users ratio of Twitter and Facebook, which are leading social network platforms. It also gives a reference point from the mobile gaming industry, specifically Zynga's portfolio, which includes a social component. This gives a broader perspective on the industry standards. The answer also correctly points out that the ideal ratio for the app in question will depend on its specific features and use cases. For instance, a location-based social network like Foursquare could potentially have a higher ratio compared to a more local event or travel focused social app. This is a valuable insight as it takes into account the unique characteristics of the app in question. However, the answer could have been more specific in providing a 'good' ratio for an 'up and coming iOS social network app', as the question asked." parameter:note="8.5" />
