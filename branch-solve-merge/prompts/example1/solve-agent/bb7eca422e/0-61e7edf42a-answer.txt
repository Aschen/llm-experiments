<Action name="analysis" usage="analysis of the answer to the question based on the criteria"> parameter:analysis="The answer provides some useful benchmarks for the ratio of daily active users to total users, citing examples from Twitter, Facebook, and Zynga. This gives a sense of what might be considered 'good' in the industry. The answer also acknowledges that the 'right' ratio can depend on the nature of the app, suggesting that a location-based social network might aim for a ratio of 40%-50%, while a more local event or travel focused social app would have a lower ceiling. However, the answer could have been more explicit in discussing the factors that can influence this ratio, such as the app's target audience, stage of growth, and marketing strategies. The answer also lacks clarity in some parts, such as the reference to 'other data points' without specifying what these are." parameter:note="7" />
