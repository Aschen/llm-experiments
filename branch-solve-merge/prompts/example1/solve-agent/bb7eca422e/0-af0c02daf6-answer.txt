<Action name="analysis" usage="analysis of the answer to the question based on the criteria"> parameter:analysis="The answer provided is comprehensive and offers a lot of valuable insights into the importance of the ratio of daily active users to total users for a social network app. It correctly emphasizes the importance of growth in daily active users as the user base expands, and it also highlights the significance of other metrics such as user drop off and logins per month. However, the answer does not provide a comparison to industry benchmarks or averages, which was a key requirement in the criteria. Without this context, it's difficult to determine what a 'good' ratio is for an up and coming iOS social network app. Therefore, while the answer is informative and provides a good understanding of the metrics involved, it does not fully meet the criteria set." parameter:note="6" />
