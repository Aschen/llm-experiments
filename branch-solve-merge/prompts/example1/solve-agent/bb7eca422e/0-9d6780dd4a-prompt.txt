A question was asked to you:
# BEGIN QUESTION
What is a good ratio of daily active users to total users for an up and coming iOS social network app?
# END QUESTION


You need to evaluate the pertinence of an answer based on the following criteria:
# BEGIN CRITERIA
The answer should cite reliable data sources. This is important for verifying the accuracy of the information provided. The sources could be industry reports, academic studies, or data from the app's own analytics. Without reliable sources, it's hard to trust the accuracy of the answer.
# END CRITERIA

This criteria is used to evaluate the answer.

The answer is:
# BEGIN ANSWER
"Aspirational" benchmarks: Twitter runs at 44% DAU to MAU and Facebook at 65%.

    Mobile games have some value as a reference point - Zynga's overall portfolio which includes a fair social component is at 26%.
    
    provides some other data points which were reasonable in my view.
    
    The right ratio to model for your app will depend on what your "location based social network" offers. Something like Foursquare that a user could reasonably use everyday might be able to achieve ~40%-50% whereas a more local event or travel focused social app would have a much lower ceiling. 
# END ANSWER
