<Action name="analysis" usage="analysis of the answer to the question based on the criteria"> parameter:analysis="The answer provided does give a general idea of what a good ratio of daily active users to total users might be for an iOS social network app. It provides a benchmark figure of around 20% for regular, indie, or startup apps, and mentions that this can vary depending on the app's category. It also provides some context by comparing this to the ratios of mega franchises like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix. However, the answer does not cite any reliable data sources to back up these figures. The only source mentioned is Quora, but no specific posts or authors are cited, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the information. The answer also assumes that the question is about the DAU to MAU ratio, which may not necessarily be the case. Overall, while the answer provides some potentially useful information, it does not fully meet the criteria due to the lack of reliable data sources." parameter:note="5" />
