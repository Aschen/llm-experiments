<Action name="analysis" usage="analysis of the answer to the question based on the criteria"> parameter:analysis="The answer provided is quite comprehensive and addresses several factors that can influence the ratio of daily active users to total users. It mentions the importance of the correlation between new sign-ups and DAU growth, indicating an understanding of the app's target audience and marketing strategies. It also highlights the significance of the app's stage of growth, suggesting that a larger sample size would provide a more accurate ratio. The answer further emphasizes the importance of other metrics such as user drop-off and logins per month, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of user engagement. However, the answer could have been more explicit in defining what a 'good' ratio might be for an up and coming iOS social network app. It also does not mention the type of app as a potential influencing factor." parameter:note="8" />
