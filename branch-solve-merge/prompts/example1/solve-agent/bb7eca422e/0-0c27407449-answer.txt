<Action name="analysis" usage="analysis of the answer to the question based on the criteria"> parameter:analysis="The answer provided is somewhat relevant to the question asked. It does not directly answer the question about the ratio of daily active users to total users for an iOS social network app, but it does provide a related metric, the DAU to MAU ratio. The answer provides a general benchmark of 20% for regular, indie, or startup apps, and notes that this can vary depending on the app's use case or category. It also provides examples of mega franchises like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix, which have much higher DAU to MAU ratios. However, the answer does not explain the factors that can influence this ratio, such as the type of app, its target audience, its stage of growth, and its marketing strategies. Therefore, while the answer is somewhat helpful, it does not fully meet the criteria." parameter:note="6" />
