<Action name="analysis" usage="analysis of the answer to the question based on the criteria"> parameter:analysis="The answer provided is quite relevant and informative. It gives a clear benchmark of 20% for regular, indie, or startup apps, which is in line with the criteria that the answer should provide a comparison to industry benchmarks or averages. The answer also provides context by mentioning that the ratio can vary depending on the use case or category of the app, with social apps typically having a higher ratio and travel apps a lower one. Furthermore, the answer provides additional context by comparing the ratio to that of mega franchises like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix, which have much higher ratios. This gives a clear picture of what the user can aspire to, even if these levels are not immediately attainable. The answer also suggests that more detailed benchmarks can be found on Quora, which could be useful for the user. However, the answer could have been more specific in providing these details directly, rather than directing the user to another platform." parameter:note="8.5" />
