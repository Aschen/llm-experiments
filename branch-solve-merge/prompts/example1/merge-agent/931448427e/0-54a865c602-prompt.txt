## Answer 0
If your daily active users % is dropping as you're growing the user base, your app is in trouble.

    From the outset, during the growth phase you want more % of users to become DAU...not less. If you're growth is not showing a correlation between new sign ups and DAU growth, your new sign ups are the wrong audience/ mis-spent marketing dollars.
    
    From a growth perspective, you would want to see an increase in DAU as more members join the network due to the expanded opportunity to connect with people and information.
    
    Having said that: 1700 users isn't really a large enough sample size, especially if many of the 167 daily users are likely friends / family / employees / invested parties, which would throw off the ratio.
    
    Also, DAU isn't the only metric. If user drop off is increasing (users who sign up and only sign in 1 or 2 times) it doesn't matter if they contribute to DAU because they never come back. The ratio of 'disinterested' or 'non sticky' users (ones who don't come back) is much more important number for a fledgling app/service.
    
    Another metric would be logins per month. Even if 90% of the sign ups never return... if the users who love you network come back more often over time, that would show a success trend. You could then try to expand within the demographic (or interests groups) that find your network irresistible. 

### Criteria Industry Benchmark
#### Analysis (note: 6) 
The answer provided is comprehensive and offers a lot of valuable insights into the importance of the ratio of daily active users to total users for a social network app. It correctly emphasizes the importance of growth in daily active users as the user base expands, and it also highlights the significance of other metrics such as user drop off and logins per month. However, the answer does not provide a comparison to industry benchmarks or averages, which was a key requirement in the criteria. Without this context, it's difficult to determine what a 'good' ratio is for an up and coming iOS social network app. Therefore, while the answer is informative and provides a good understanding of the metrics involved, it does not fully meet the criteria set.

### Criteria Explanation of Factors
#### Analysis (note: 8) 
The answer provided is quite comprehensive and addresses several factors that can influence the ratio of daily active users to total users. It mentions the importance of the correlation between new sign-ups and DAU growth, indicating an understanding of the app's target audience and marketing strategies. It also highlights the significance of the app's stage of growth, suggesting that a larger sample size would provide a more accurate ratio. The answer further emphasizes the importance of other metrics such as user drop-off and logins per month, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of user engagement. However, the answer could have been more explicit in defining what a 'good' ratio might be for an up and coming iOS social network app. It also does not mention the type of app as a potential influencing factor.

### Criteria Data Source
#### Analysis (note: 4) 
The answer provided is insightful and offers a comprehensive understanding of the metrics that should be considered when evaluating the success of a social network app. It highlights the importance of not only looking at the ratio of daily active users to total users, but also considering other factors such as user drop off and logins per month. However, the answer does not meet the criteria set for this question. It does not cite any reliable data sources such as industry reports, academic studies, or data from the app's own analytics. Without these sources, it's difficult to verify the accuracy of the information provided. The answer is based on general knowledge and experience, but it lacks the concrete data and references required by the criteria.

## Answer 1
"Aspirational" benchmarks: Twitter runs at 44% DAU to MAU and Facebook at 65%.

    Mobile games have some value as a reference point - Zynga's overall portfolio which includes a fair social component is at 26%.
    
    provides some other data points which were reasonable in my view.
    
    The right ratio to model for your app will depend on what your "location based social network" offers. Something like Foursquare that a user could reasonably use everyday might be able to achieve ~40%-50% whereas a more local event or travel focused social app would have a much lower ceiling. 

### Criteria Industry Benchmark
#### Analysis (note: 8) 
The answer provided is quite relevant and meets the criteria well. It provides industry benchmarks by mentioning the daily active users to monthly active users ratio of Twitter and Facebook, which are leading social network platforms. It also gives a reference point from the mobile gaming industry, specifically Zynga's portfolio, which includes a social component. This gives a broader perspective on the industry standards. The answer also correctly points out that the ideal ratio for the app in question will depend on its specific features and use cases. For instance, a location-based social network like Foursquare could potentially have a higher ratio compared to a more local event or travel focused social app. This is a valuable insight as it takes into account the unique characteristics of the app in question. However, the answer could have been more specific in providing a 'good' ratio for an 'up and coming iOS social network app', as the question asked.

### Criteria Explanation of Factors
#### Analysis (note: 7) 
The answer provides some useful benchmarks for the ratio of daily active users to total users, citing examples from Twitter, Facebook, and Zynga. This gives a sense of what might be considered 'good' in the industry. The answer also acknowledges that the 'right' ratio can depend on the nature of the app, suggesting that a location-based social network might aim for a ratio of 40%-50%, while a more local event or travel focused social app would have a lower ceiling. However, the answer could have been more explicit in discussing the factors that can influence this ratio, such as the app's target audience, stage of growth, and marketing strategies. The answer also lacks clarity in some parts, such as the reference to 'other data points' without specifying what these are.

### Criteria Data Source
#### Analysis (note: 4) 
The answer provided does give some useful benchmarks for daily active users to total users ratio, citing Twitter, Facebook, and Zynga as examples. However, it fails to meet the criteria of citing reliable data sources. The answer does not provide any references to industry reports, academic studies, or data from the app's own analytics. The sources of the data points are not mentioned, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the information provided. Furthermore, the answer is somewhat vague in its advice, stating that the 'right' ratio will depend on the nature of the app without providing any concrete guidance or data to support this claim.

## Answer 2
I assume you are asking about the Daily Active User to Monthly Active Users ratio (DAU to MAU)

    Short version: if you are a “regular”, “indie” or “startup” app, ~20% is a reasonable benchmark generically. It really depends on your use case/category (social will be higher whereas travel would be low)
    
    Mega franchises have much higher DAU to MAUs (Facebook mid 60s, Twitter and Netflix low 40s)….but they really are at a different level that makes them aspirational only in most cases.
    
    There are a number of DAU to MAU benchmarks throughout Quora (including a handful of my answers) if you need more details.
    
    Hope that helped at all.

### Criteria Industry Benchmark
#### Analysis (note: 8) 
The answer provided is quite relevant and informative. It gives a clear benchmark of 20% for regular, indie, or startup apps, which is in line with the criteria that the answer should provide a comparison to industry benchmarks or averages. The answer also provides context by mentioning that the ratio can vary depending on the use case or category of the app, with social apps typically having a higher ratio and travel apps a lower one. Furthermore, the answer provides additional context by comparing the ratio to that of mega franchises like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix, which have much higher ratios. This gives a clear picture of what the user can aspire to, even if these levels are not immediately attainable. The answer also suggests that more detailed benchmarks can be found on Quora, which could be useful for the user. However, the answer could have been more specific in providing these details directly, rather than directing the user to another platform.

### Criteria Explanation of Factors
#### Analysis (note: 6) 
The answer provided is somewhat relevant to the question asked. It does not directly answer the question about the ratio of daily active users to total users for an iOS social network app, but it does provide a related metric, the DAU to MAU ratio. The answer provides a general benchmark of 20% for regular, indie, or startup apps, and notes that this can vary depending on the app's use case or category. It also provides examples of mega franchises like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix, which have much higher DAU to MAU ratios. However, the answer does not explain the factors that can influence this ratio, such as the type of app, its target audience, its stage of growth, and its marketing strategies. Therefore, while the answer is somewhat helpful, it does not fully meet the criteria.

### Criteria Data Source
#### Analysis (note: 5) 
The answer provided does give a general idea of what a good ratio of daily active users to total users might be for an iOS social network app. It provides a benchmark figure of around 20% for regular, indie, or startup apps, and mentions that this can vary depending on the app's category. It also provides some context by comparing this to the ratios of mega franchises like Facebook, Twitter, and Netflix. However, the answer does not cite any reliable data sources to back up these figures. The only source mentioned is Quora, but no specific posts or authors are cited, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of the information. The answer also assumes that the question is about the DAU to MAU ratio, which may not necessarily be the case. Overall, while the answer provides some potentially useful information, it does not fully meet the criteria due to the lack of reliable data sources.
